LEFT OFF: Updated the db with foreign keys in the TagAlways... table. Test to make sure everything still works. I just created a better mapping method in the database service. 
	Mapping to an existing object rather than a new one. I also created a method that gets the primary key of an entity. Update all of the methods in the database service to 
	use these and return better objects

= Add basic actions to all my controllers
= Populate the relationships tables
	= Create basic "full" query methods in my services for each type and test all the gets
	= Start working with editing relationsips
= Figure out how to remove NotesAppContext from my database service and user a dbContext or some interface somehow
= I need validate the incoming models before calling my services
